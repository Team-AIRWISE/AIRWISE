# Team Airwise

This is the repository the AIRWISE device, which is an entry to the PA PI Raspberry Pi competition.
Team AIRWISE consists of two pupils at Tynecastle High School, Akshith Bhimanere and Dylan Hill.

## The Airwise device
The AIRWISE device's to meticulously measure the air quality of a room/indoor area, and to correct humidity levels. This is achieved by using a Kitronik Air quality control hat, and reading the air quality values through it. This is an open-source project encouraging others to further build on this project, see the code behind it, and build an AIRWISE themselves
